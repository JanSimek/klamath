This is a simple text file containing indexed strings of text. Each line
uses the DOS style end of line markers CRLF
(":raw-latex:`\r`:raw-latex:`\n`"). This file format is used in the
displaying of subtitles when playing a MVE file.

Comments and blank lines are not allowed in this file format.

Each line is of the format index:followed by a line of text, where index
is an integer.

Here is the Indexed Text file artimer4.sve, to illustrate the format.

10:Chosen? Chosen? Do you hear me? 90:The village dies. All of our
futures die, too. 180:We have little left in both time and essence.
270:Hurry. Hurry...
