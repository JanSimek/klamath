A Description of the LIP File Format v2 Used in Fallout 2

This document will describe the internals of the .LIP format (version 2) used in the Fallout 2 engine. This information was obtained through the analysis of the corresponding functions found in Fallout2.exe


===1. FRM files: The Talking Heads===

The name of the files used for graphical conversation takes the following form.

 RootSuffix1Suffix2[Sufix3].frm

Where:

Root - Root file name eg. “ELDER” (5 characters)

Suffix1 - 1st suffix, indicates disposition (1 character)

Suffix2 - 2nd suffix, indicates file contents (1 character)

Suffix3 - 3rd suffix, indicates index number for fidget files (usually 1 character but theoretically could be more if you had over 9 fidget files)


The first suffix indicates that the graphics in this .FRM file have a certain disposition. G is good, B is bad, N is neutral. The second suffix indicates what type of animation is contained in the file, transition, fidgeting or phonemes. Transition animations show a person moving from one disposition to another. Fidgeting animations show the character blinking or nodding or something. Phoneme animations contain 9 possible positions for the characters mouth to be in. These are the ones that are used within the .LIP file format.


The possible values and their meanings for the suffixes are given in table 1.1


Table 1.1 – Values of suffix1, suffix2, suffix3 and their purpose.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Suffix1 !! Suffix2 !! Suffix3 !! Purpose
|-
| ‘g’ || ‘v’ || - || Unknown, no files use this combination 
|-
| ‘g’ || ‘f’ || 1,2,… || Fidget animations for the “good” disposition 
|-
| ‘g’ || ‘n’ || - || Transition animation from good to neutral disposition 
|-
| ‘n’ || ‘g’ || - || Transition animation from neutral to good disposition 
|-
| ‘n’ || ‘f’ || 1,2,… || Fidget animations for the “neutral” disposition 
|-
| ‘n’ || ‘b’ || - || Transition animation from neutral to bad disposition 
|-
| ‘b’ || ‘n’ || - || Transition animation from bad to neutral disposition 
|-
| ‘b’ || ‘f’ || 1,2,… || Fidget animations for the “bad” disposition 
|-
| ‘b’ || ‘v’ || - || Unknown, no files use this combination 
|-
|| ‘g’ || ‘p’ || - || Phoneme images for the “good” disposition 
|-
| ‘n’ || ‘p’ || - || Phoneme images for the “neutral” disposition 
|-
| ‘b’ || ‘p’ || - || Phoneme images for the “bad” disposition 
|}
NOTE: The maximum values for the fidget file numbers (suffix3) are determined in the “heads.lst” file (in /data/art/heads). This file is formatted as such:
 ROOT X, Y, Z
Where ROOT is the root filename, X is the number of “good” fidget files, Y is the number of “neutral” fidget files and Z is the number of “bad” fidget files. 

Example
Root file name: myron.

NOTE: Phoneme files (with suffix3 == ‘p’) must have at least 9 frames. There can be more, but the engine will only use the first 9.


NOTE: The game engine will play a random fidget file at the end of each speech segment which corresponds to the current disposition.

|-

|-
| 0x001С || 4 || unsigned || NUM-OF-MARKERS: Total number of position markers stored in this file. Always equal to(NUM-OF-PHONEMES + 1) because a 0 secondframe with the mouth closed is inserted to the beginning of each speech sequence.

|-
| 0x002С || 1 || unsigned = [0x00..0x29] || PHONEM-0: Phoneme 0 This is the first byte in a single byte list of phoneme codes which correspond to a frame in the .FRM file being used. (See table 2.1)
